# Building Multi AI agent Chatbot with External Tools Using LangGraph
* Inside this project, I have built an AI Chatbot Application using Groq API key and LangGraph combining with multiple tools such as Arxiv and Wikipedia.
* By doing this, whenever the user inputs a query the LLM model calls the tool and based on the question it decides which tool to use to answer it.

## Setup
* The program is entirely built and run on Google colab
